# Blog Form Transition and Image URL Fixes

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **useActionState Transition Warning**
**Problem**: Getting warning "An async function with useActionState was called outside of a transition"

**Root Cause**: The form was calling `formAction()` manually in JavaScript instead of using it as a form action prop.

**Solution**: 
- Added `action={formAction}` prop to the form element
- Modified `handleSubmit` to only handle image uploads, then let the form submit naturally
- Removed manual `formAction()` calls and `useTransition` usage

### 2. **Invalid Image URL Validation**
**Problem**: Local image paths like `/images/blog/1759043922517-image.png` were being rejected as "Invalid URL"

**Root Cause**: The Zod schema in `actions-mongodb.ts` was using `z.string().url()` which only accepts full URLs, not relative paths.

**Solution**: Updated the schema to accept both:
- Relative paths starting with `/` (for local images)
- Full URLs (for external images)

## üîß **Technical Changes**

### `src/components/blog-form.tsx`
1. **Form Action**: Added `action={formAction}` to form element
2. **Submit Handler**: Modified to handle image upload first, then natural form submission
3. **Removed**: `useTransition`, `startTransition`, and manual `formAction()` calls

### `src/app/blog/actions-mongodb.ts`
1. **Schema Update**: Modified `imageUrl` validation to accept relative paths and URLs
2. **Better Validation**: Uses `refine()` to check both path formats

## üìã **How It Works Now**

### Image Upload Flow:
1. **User selects image** ‚Üí File stored in component state
2. **Form submission** ‚Üí `handleSubmit` intercepts if image needs upload
3. **Image upload** ‚Üí File uploaded to `/api/upload-image`, returns path like `/images/blog/timestamp-filename.ext`
4. **Form update** ‚Üí Hidden input updated with new image path
5. **Natural submission** ‚Üí Form submits normally using `action` prop
6. **Validation** ‚Üí Schema accepts the relative path format
7. **Database save** ‚Üí Blog post saved with correct image path

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ **No transition warnings**: Form uses proper React form action pattern
- ‚úÖ **Valid image paths**: Local paths like `/images/blog/123-image.png` accepted
- ‚úÖ **Proper loading states**: `isPending` from `useActionState` works correctly
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Both upload and save errors handled appropriately

## üéØ **Validation Rules**

The updated schema now accepts:
- **Relative paths**: `/images/blog/image.png` ‚úÖ
- **Full URLs**: `https://example.com/image.png` ‚úÖ
- **Invalid formats**: `invalid-path` ‚ùå

## üß™ **Testing**

To verify the fixes:
1. Go to `/blog` page
2. Click "Add Post"
3. Upload a new image or select from gallery
4. Fill form and submit
5. Check for:
   - No console warnings about transitions
   - Successful image display
   - Proper form submission

The blog form now follows React best practices and handles both local and external images correctly!
